### Backend

- Create a command line program that allows user to perform  file operations such as
- Listing files in a directory
- Creating new files
- Deleting files
- Searching for files based on certain criteria
- The system must support text and binary files

#### Backend Hints

Your main function should be very minimal
Donâ€™t open files(only for previewing/debugging)

Create appropriate utility functions for the front end
Think about what the frontend needs

### FrontEnd

You are developing a basic inventory management system for a store and they need a simple system to keep track of :
Each product is represent by a record containing information such as:

- Product Id
- Name
- Quantity
- Price.

Read and write reports(text files
The content is up to you

Manage records(binary files)
Record operation should include:

- Add record
- View record
- Search record
- Update record
- Delete record

#### Frontend hints

Think about what the backend is implementing for you
the frontend is not doing the file handling

focus on what the user needs to see create a simple UI in the console
Make clear requests to the colleagues handling the backend

## General tips

split the work among the team assign a team leader.

Decide on the functions that the backend implement and how the front end will use them
Input ? Parameter ? Output ?
Work independtly and integrate in time for testing
Not too early Not too late
